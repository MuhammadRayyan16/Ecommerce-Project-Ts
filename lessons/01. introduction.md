Hello and welcome to my coding course to build a full-fledged e-commerce website exactly like amazon by the best tech stack in the world: Nextjs, Postgres Database and Shadcn UI.

- we will develop an attractive homepage that follows the best design practices we have. A hero section, new collections, ongoing deals, all complemented by shop features.

- we'll create a search page that allows users to explore products, apply category, price and rating filters like amazon.

- Also we develop a concise product Details page with variants selection, rate and review product and product recommendations.

- we implement a shopping cart system which works with or without authentication. users can adjust quantity, get instant updates to the pricing or remove products from the cart.

- We create user authentication with a secure login using google, magic link, and email&password.

- Then, we develop a simple checkout process which is optimized for the best user experience, get shipping address using google map and process payments by PayPal or Stripe.

- and you'll also develop a user-friendly account page which allows users to update personal information see past purchases, order details and of course a log out option.

- that's just the start the real fun is the admin panel from where you can control absolutely anything on your shop website starting from ecommerce overview, easily add new products, oversee orders and manage customers.
